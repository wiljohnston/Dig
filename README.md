# Dig

Dig is an add-on to puppeteer that can be used to grab element handles from a webpage that are too hard to reach with a single query selector. This is very powerful with the chromium headless browser (puppeteer), as you can scrape just about anything with waitfors, callbacks, and selectors laid out in the dig instructions.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you've already installed puppeteer into your project

```
npm install puppeteer
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
